Block chain based ledger/audit trail

Blockchain-Based Audit Trail System

This project is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to provide immutable audit trails for financial transactions. The goal is to create a transparent and reliable way for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to track transaction history and ensure data integrity.

Features

    Immutable Ledger: Record transactions securely using a blockchain-based system.
    Transparency: Provides SMEs with a tamper-proof way of tracking transaction history.
    Frontend Interface: Allows users to interact with the blockchain ledger via a user-friendly frontend.

Requirements

    Node.js (version 16+ recommended)
    Hardhat
    MetaMask (for connecting to the blockchain)
    Local blockchain (using Hardhat Network)

Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine and install the necessary dependencies.

bash

# Clone the repository

git clone [<repository-url>](https://github.com/GruffElixir/scs2.0_audit_trails.git)

# Change into the project directory

cd scs2.0_audit_trails

# Install dependencies for both backend and frontend

npm install

Dependencies

This project uses the following main dependencies:

    Hardhat: Ethereum development environment.
    ethers.js: Library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
    React: Frontend framework for building user interfaces.

Project Structure

The main folders in this project are:

    contracts/: Contains the Solidity smart contract.
    frontend/: Contains the React frontend.
    scripts/: Contains deployment scripts.

Deployment

To deploy the smart contract locally on Hardhat’s local blockchain, follow these steps.

    Compile the Smart Contracts

    Compile the smart contract using Hardhat.

    bash

npx hardhat compile

Deploy Locally

Deploy the smart contract to the local Hardhat network.

bash

npx hardhat node

This command will start a local blockchain instance and display a list of accounts with their private keys. Leave this terminal open, as it serves as your local blockchain.

Deploy the Contract

In a new terminal, deploy the contract to this local blockchain network.

bash

    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

    You should see output in the console indicating the contract’s address. Note this address, as you will need it to connect the frontend.

Running the Frontend

    Navigate to the Frontend Directory

    bash

cd frontend

Configure MetaMask for Local Blockchain

    Open MetaMask and add a custom RPC network.
    Use http://localhost:8545 as the RPC URL.
    Use 1337 as the Chain ID.

Import an account by using the private key of any account generated by Hardhat.

Add Contract Address in Frontend

In frontend/src/ContractConnector.js, update the contract address to the one you obtained during deployment.

javascript

const contractAddress = "YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE";

Run the Frontend Application

Now, start the React app.

bash

    npm start

    This will open the frontend at http://localhost:3000, where you can interact with the smart contract.

Usage

    Add a New Block: Enter the sender, receiver, amount, and purpose for a transaction and submit. This will create a new block in the blockchain.
    View Blocks: Navigate to the dashboard to see a list of all added blocks.

Troubleshooting

    Error: Transaction ran out of gas: Increase the gas limit when sending transactions.
    Error fetching blocks: Make sure MetaMask is connected to the correct local network.
    Blank Page: Check if the contract address in ContractConnector.js matches the deployed address.
